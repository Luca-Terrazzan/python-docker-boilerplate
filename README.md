# Python docker boilerplate

This is a super simple collection of files to bootstrap a docker development environemnt
for python applications.

This is especially useful with VSCode remote development extension, in order to develop
directly within your docker environment without modifying your host machine.

## Usage

Just run `docker compose up -d` and you are set with a container on the latest python image.
If you are usging VSCode you can immediately start your docker dev setup by executing the
`attach to running container` command.
